# olcPixelGameEngine-code
A collection of my self made code using the olcPixelGameEngine

**New:** To view these programs online, go to my [itch.io](https://slartibartfastbb.itch.io/) account. 

- **olcMazeManic.cpp** A 3D style maze using rectangles and triangles that change colour to give a perception of depth and passages.  Based on an Amstrad CPC 464 Basic program from the book 'Sensational Games for the CPC 464'.

- **olcMad.cpp** A Pixel Game Engine version of the Mad Magazine code from October 1985.  Really easy to implement on the PGE.  see https://meatfighter.com/mad/

- **olcFourierSeries.cpp** Fourier Series demonstration the create a Square, Triangle, Sawtooth and Cubic Wave.

- **olcFourierEpicycles.cpp** Using Fourier Transforms to draw a picture with Epicycles.

- **olcFourierEpicyclesXY.cpp** Using Fourier Transforms to draw a picture with Epicycles with separte X and Y plots.

- **olcMineSweeper.cpp** Mine Sweeper using the Pixel Game Engine.  Left mouse button reveals, Right mouse button flags

- **olcCardioid.cpp** Cardioid generations with increasing factor size.  This creates many interesting patterns.  Move the mouse to change the number of points from 0 to 200

- **olcMetaballs.cpp** Metaballs are organic-looking n-dimensional isosurfaces, characterised by their ability to meld together when in close proximity to create single, contiguous objects.

- **olcCirclePacking.cpp** In geometry, circle packing is the study of the arrangement of circles (of equal or varying sizes) on a given surface such that no overlapping occurs and so that no circle can be enlarged without creating an overlap.  This program places a circle over a PNG file where the colour white is shown.

- **olcCirclePackingPic.cpp** Circle Packing routine as above but using a picture pixel colour to colour each circle.  It makes a nice looking image.

- **olcHilbert.cpp** The Hilbert curve (also known as the Hilbert space-filling curve) is a continuous fractal space-filling curve first described by the German mathematician David Hilbert in 1891. Use the arrow keys to change the order from 1 to 9.

- **olcFireworks.cpp** This is a simple fireworks program that shoots fireworks up and lets them explode.  It uses simple velocity, acceleration and gravity to move the fireworks.

- **olcPrimeSpiral.cpp** When Prime numbers are displayed in a spiral, they form a pattern!  This program displays the pattern and gives options to change the spiral size and look.

- **olcLissajous.cpp** Lissajous Curve generator.  Curves are generated by mapping Polar coordinates to increasing angle rates.  When the vertical and horizontal lines intersect, a curve is drawn.  Use the arrow keys to change the number of columns from 1 to 20 and the phase from 0 to 2PI.

- **olcColourMe.cpp** Colour Me is a Pixel Drawaing Game where a picture is made based on colour matching via a series of numbers.  There are four pictures to choose from. Use the mouse to select the colour and click or click and drag to select paint the colour.

- **olcAutonomousAgent.cpp** This program implements a steering mechanism where flies seek out the nearest food and avoid spiders. If a fly touches a spider, it dies. If any are let at the end, they seek out and settle on the large Poo. As it is all random the flies seem to have a mind of their own. **Note**, I was lazy on the spider physics so they just move in a random direction.
