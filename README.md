# olcPixelGameEngine-code
A collection of my self made code using the olcPixelGameEngine

- **olcMazeMania.cpp** A 3D style maze using rectangles and triangles that change colour to give a perception of depth and passages.  Based off a Amstrad CPC 434 Basic program from the book 'Sensational Games for the CPC 464'. ![olcMazeMania](/images/olcMazeMania.png)
- **olcMad.cpp** A Pixel Game Engine version of the Mad Magazine code from October 1985.  Really easy to implement on the PGE.  see https://meatfighter.com/mad/ ![olcMad](/images/olcMad.png)
